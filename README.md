🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease
🎯 Project Description
Tomatoes are one of the most extensively grown vegetables in any country, and their diseases can significantly affect yield and quality. Accurate and early detection of tomato diseases is crucial for reducing losses and improving crop management.

In this project, I will be appllying the power of Deep Learning to detect and classify the various stages of blight in tomato leaves. , making automation of disease detection more efficient and accessible.

📃 The Dataset
The dataset consists of 3 different folders, each containing images of tomato leaves with the respective syndroms:

Healthy
Early blight
Late blight
📚 The Notebook Structure
⚙️ Notebook Preparation - Import libraries, initialize constants and download dataset.
🔎 Data Exploration - Visualize data and confirm the distribution of different classes.
🪓 Data Splitting - Split data into Train, Validation and Testing sets.
🧹 Data Preprocessing - Load and preprocess images to ensure compatibility with neural networks.
🛠️ Model Building - Build a CNN model using TensorFlow.
📈 Model Training - Train model on the dataset, and use a separate validation set to monitor its performance.
📊 Model Evaluation - Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set.
🔝 Model Improvement - Try different strategies to improve the model's performance.
